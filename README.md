# BrightNetworkUK_Google
As part of the Bright Network Technology internship program, I was given a Coding Challenge by Google
This challenge was Software Engineering based and so initially I was out of my depth. However I persevered and managed to complete part 1 of the challenge. 
The code I wrote **so far** can be found in the src file, under video_player. 
I learned more about **Object Oriented Programming** when trying to solve this challenge, and I will continue to do so until I eventually complete the challenge.
